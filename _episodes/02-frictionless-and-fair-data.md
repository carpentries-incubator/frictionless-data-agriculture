## Frictionless Data and FAIR Data ##
FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable and provides an important set of guiding principles for creating reusable datasets.  

Using Frictionless can help you to create datasets that meet some of the key principles of the FAIR data principles. Using Frictionles can meet 10 of the 15 FAIR guiding principles. These are:
- F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier 
- F2. Data are described with rich metadata
- F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier they describe
- I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.  
- I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles
- I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data
- R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
- R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license
- R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance
- R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

In future lessons we will see where Frictionless data is used to support these FAIR data principles.
