## Frictionless Data and FAIR Data ##
FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable and provides an important set of guiding principles for creating reusable datasets. The FAIR data principles are being widely adopted across the research community for improving re-use of datasets

Frictionless is intended to create well described and re-usable datasets and this objective aligns strongly with the FAIR Data Principles. Therefore before we start creating our first Frictionless Data Package lets identify the FAIR Data principles we can meet by using Frictionless Data.    

For more information on the FAIR Data Principles visit [GO-FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/).

FAIR has 15 principles and using Frictionles we can meet 10 of them, These are:
- F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier 
- F2. Data are described with rich metadata
- F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier they describe
- I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.  
- I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles
- I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data
- R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
- R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license
- R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance
- R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

In future lessons we will see where Frictionless data is used to support these FAIR data principles.
