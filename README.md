**Thanks for contributing to The Carpentries Incubator!**

Frictionless Data is a progressive framework for building data infrastructure. Frictionless can do:
- data management
- data integration
- data flows 

Frictionless allows users to describe data using a straightforward syntax. Frictionless describes a datasets as a collection of one or more data tables having rows and columns. Frictionless provides metadata to describe columns, tables and a dataset.

This lesson teaches the principles of Frictionless Data, and the basics of how to create, use and transform Frictionless data.

This lesson uses example data from Agricultural field experiments and is directly relevant to agricultural scientists and ecologists.
