- data flows 

Frictionless allows users to describe data using a straightforward syntax. Frictionless describes a datasets as a collection of one or more data tables having rows and columns. Frictionless provides metadata to describe columns, tables and a dataset.

This lesson teaches the principles of Frictionless Data, and the basics of how to create, use and transform Frictionless data.

After completing this lesson you will:
1. Understand the concept and principles of Frictionless Data
2. Use graphical and Python to create a Frictionless Data Package
3. Use Python to read a data package 
4. Use Python to join data from different data packages
5. Use Python to create Frictionless data transformation pipeline

This lesson uses example data from Agricultural field experiments and is directly relevant to agricultural scientists and ecologists.
