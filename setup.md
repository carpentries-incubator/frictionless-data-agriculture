This lesson aims to teach researchers the basic concepts and skills for using the Frictionless Data format to describe and package tabular data. The lesson uses a tabular agricultural field experiment dataset and teaches data description and metadata and data manipulation using the Frictionless Python modules.  

## Overview
This lesson is designed to be run on your laptop. First you need to download the data we will use then install the Frictionless Python modules. After following the instructions on this page you should have everything you need to get started.  

## Dataset
Download the dataset (#TODO repo link) to your work python environment. The download should include the following three files:
1. experiment.csv
2. varieties.csv
